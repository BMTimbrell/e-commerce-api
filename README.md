# E-commerce API

## About

This is an API I made using Node and Express for an [E-commerce app](https://github.com/BMTimbrell/e-commerce-app).
It queries a database I made using Postgres, which I hosted on Supabase. I used Render to host the server.

## Features

* User registration and login using Passport.js for authentication
* Endpoints for fetching products, user information and order information
* Endpoints for updating user information as well as shopping cart
* Uses node-postgres to connect to and query PostgreSQL database
* Middleware for checking if a user can perform certain requests
